# Exercise 1: A Good First Program
# Type the following text into a single file named ex1.py. This is important as Python works best with files ending in .py.

print "Hello Again"
print "I like typing this."
print "This is fun."
print 'Yay! Printing.'
print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
print 'I "said" do not touch this.'

# Study Drills

# For this exercise, try these things:

# 1. Make your script print another line.
print "another line."

# 2. Make your script print only one of the lines.
# Just delete or comment the other lines.

# 3. Put a '#' (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.
# The '#' character at the beginning of a line makes a line a comment.
